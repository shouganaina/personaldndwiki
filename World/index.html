        <h2> üåç The World of Morn</h2>
        <p>Morn is a land of contrasts: sprawling cities bound by law, wild reaches scarred by ancient wars, and distant realms whose philosophies shape the fates of nations.
          Power, in all its forms‚Äîpolitical, martial, and arcane‚Äîdefines life here. The kingdoms of Morn are not united, but bound together by rivalries, fragile treaties, and the weight of history.</p>
        <h3>Aldarien: Crown of the West</h3>
        <p>he kingdom of <strong>Aldarien</strong> stands as one of the most powerful realms on Morn, a nation of knights, nobles, and rigid law.
          From its seat in <strong>Askenhalt</strong>, Aldarien‚Äôs crown exerts influence far beyond its borders.
          Its rulers have brought stability to fractured regions, encouraged commerce, and championed great works of architecture and infrastructure.</p>

        <p>Yet Aldarien‚Äôs power is double-edged. The kingdom‚Äôs bureaucracy is suffocating, its laws intricate and unforgiving.
            Magical practices are heavily regulated, with spellcasters treated less as free practitioners and more as resources of the state.
            Critics whisper that Aldarien preserves order not out of benevolence, but to keep its people tightly bound.</p>

        <p>Despite this, Aldarien is a cultural beacon.
            Its universities produce renowned scholars, its armies remain unmatched, and its courts dictate much of the political rhythm of Morn.
            For better or worse, Aldarien is a cornerstone of the world‚Äôs future.</p>

        <h3>Az‚ÄôArum: The Mystic East</h3>
        <p>To the east lies <strong>Az‚ÄôArum</strong>, a land steeped in philosophy, ritual, and spiritual study. Where Aldarien rules by steel and law, Az‚ÄôArum guides by faith and knowledge. Its people see the world as a harmony of forces, both natural and divine, and their scholars have produced tomes and doctrines studied across Morn.
          Az‚ÄôArum‚Äôs temples rise higher than its palaces, and its mystics command deep respect. It is said that within Az‚ÄôArum lies the most complete understanding of the gods, the planes, and the nature of magic itself. Pilgrims from across Morn travel there seeking enlightenment, relics, or forgotten wisdom.
          But Az‚ÄôArum is not without shadows. The realm‚Äôs introspection often leaves it insular, and its councils have been accused of manipulating foreign powers through selective trade of knowledge and prophecy. Where Aldarien enforces order with the sword, Az‚ÄôArum exerts influence through secrets, silence, and truths best left veiled.</p>

        <h3>The Black Fangs and the Shadow Trade</h3>
        <p>Beyond borders and crowns lies a power both insidious and adaptable: the <strong>Black Fangs</strong>. This syndicate thrives in the cracks of Morn‚Äôs societies, smuggling relics, bribing guards, and operating markets where forbidden goods and darker magics flow freely.
          In Aldarien, they infiltrate law enforcement and commerce. In Az‚ÄôArum, they traffic in stolen scrolls and relics. The Black Fangs are less a gang than a network, tied together by symbols, oaths, and the promise of power in places where the law cannot tread. For rulers, the Black Fangs are a pestilence; for outcasts, they are opportunity.</p>

        <h3>Magic and Its Boundaries</h3>
        <p>Magic in Morn is not equally accessible.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Divine and pact magic</strong> (clerics, paladins, warlocks) depends on bonds with gods, patrons, or primal forces.</li>
          <li><strong>Primal magic</strong> (druids) is tied to ancient nature spirits and elemental guardians.</li>
          <li><strong>True magic</strong> (wizards, sorcerers) is the most feared. Wizards weave <strong>veridium energy</strong>, turning study into power. Sorcerers are rarer still, born with inherent power often tied to bloodlines or cataclysmic events.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In Aldarien, such magic is bound by law and license. In Az‚ÄôArum, it is studied, debated, and tested against doctrine. Between them lies tension: one seeks to control magic for order, the other to understand it for enlightenment.</p>

        <h3>The Wider World</h3>
        <p>Beyond Aldarien and Az‚ÄôArum stretch lands less charted, where tribes, minor kingdoms, and city-states rise and fall without shaping the greater political balance. Ancient ruins dot these regions, whispers of empires long dead. Some speak of realms across the seas, but little is known beyond scattered merchant tales.
          Morn itself feels ancient, as though civilizations merely build atop layers of forgotten ages. Dungeons beneath castles, ruins beneath cities, and cathedrals beneath marketplaces remind all who live here that history is rarely buried‚Äîit is only waiting to be uncovered.</p>

        <h3>A World in Tension</h3>
        <p>Morn is defined not by peace, but by balance. Aldarien‚Äôs strict rule and expansionism pull against Az‚ÄôArum‚Äôs mysticism and secrecy. Outlaws, syndicates, and hidden sects gnaw at their foundations. And beneath it all, the scars of ancient curses, planar rifts, and the hunger of magic itself threaten to reshape everything.
          This is Morn: a world where knowledge is power, law is both shield and chain, and survival depends on choosing carefully where to stand when the balance shifts.</p>
